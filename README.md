# Java Practice Programs

This repository contains the Java programs I wrote while learning and practicing the fundamentals of the Java language. It tracks my progress, experiments, and the concepts I explored during my learning phase.

---

## 📚 Overview
This repo includes a variety of practice programs covering core Java topics, such as:

- Basic syntax and operators  
- Conditional statements and loops  
- Methods and modular programming  
- Object-oriented programming (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.)  
- Arrays and strings  
- Exception handling  
- File handling (if applicable)  
- Miscellaneous practice problems

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this repository is simple:
- To document my Java learning journey  
- To keep my practice work organized  
- To serve as a reference for reviewing and improving concepts  

This is not production-level code — it’s practice, plain and simple.
